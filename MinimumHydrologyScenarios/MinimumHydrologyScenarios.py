# MinimumHydrologyScenariosCode.py

#################

# Purpose
# This code iterates through all ensembles and traces in HydrologyScenarios.xlsx
#   by Homa Salehabadi (2023). During the iterations, the code finds the most minimum
#   consecutive years. The user chooses the window.

# Please report bugs/feedback to: Anabelle Myers A02369941@aggies.usu.edu
