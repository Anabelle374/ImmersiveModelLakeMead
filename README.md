# Quantifying Data for Extreme Low Inflow and Extreme Low Storage Scenarios for Lake Mead

This code quantifies data to find extreme low inflow and extreme low storage data for Lake Mead. The data then is used in modeling Lake Mead management scenarios. The data from these modeling sessions is then quantified. 

## Description of Contents
1. **HydrologyScenarios** This folder contains code identifies periods of three-, four-, and 10-year extreme low natural flow at Lee Ferry. The code also identifies when the rolling sum of ten consecutive values sums to less than 75 million acre-feet (maf). These values are pulled out from the traces and ensembles in the HydrologyScenarios.xlsx file (Salehabadi, 2024). There are 22 ensembles and 1750 traces in this data set. The results of this code are used to create scenarios of extreme low inflow to Lake Mead used for Immersive Modeling..
2. **ImmersiveModelSessionData** - This folder contains and excel sheet, code, and graphs that quantify data collected from Immersive Model for Lake Mead Based on the Principle of Divide Reservoir Inflow.
