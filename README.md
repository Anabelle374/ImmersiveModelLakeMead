# ImmersiveModelLakeMead
This code identifies the three lowest consecutive values within each trace and ensemble from HydrologyScenarios (Salehabadi, 2023).
## HydrologyScenarios.xlsx
This excel sheet, created by Homa Salehabadi, shows inflow values to Lee's Ferry for differing hydrolog scenarios. Values from these ensembles and traces were used in the ImmersiveModelLakeMead code.
## MinimumResultsHydrologicScenarios.xlsx
This excel sheet with the calculated three lowest consecutive values from each ensemble.
## Min_Code
### MinimumHydrologicScenarios.py
This is documentation of code used to calculate the three most minimum values of each trace in each ensemble from HydrologicScenarios.xlsx. The overall minimum three consecutive values of each ensemble are also calculated by the code. Ensemble is chosen to be calculated by user input.
### Individual Ensemble
There is no user input required to run this code, but the specific code file must be run to get the results from the specific ensemble.
