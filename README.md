# Supporting Extreme Low Reservoir Inflows for Immersive Model for Lake Mead
This code identifies periods of three-, four-, and 10-year extreme low natural flow at Lee Ferry. 
The code also identifies when the rolling sum of ten consecutive values sums to less than 75 million acre-feet (maf).
These values are pulled out from the traces and ensembles in the HydrologyScenarios.xlsx file (Salehabadi, 2024).
The results of this code are used to create scenarios of extreme low inflow to Lake Mead.

## Description of Contents
1. **HydrologyScenarios.xlsx** is the input for all three codes. This workbook comes from Salehabadi et al, 2024). A furthur description can be found below in the Input section.
1. **MinimumHydrologyScenarios** - Folder  contains the Python code (MinimumHydrologyScenarios.py) used to find 3-, 4-, and 10-year minimum flows.
1. **Old** - Folder with older versions of Python code.
1. **MinimumHydrologyScenarios/Results** - Subfolder that contains results in Excel files, e.g., **3yearsMinimumHydrologyResults.xlsx**.

### Code (MinimumHydrologyScenarios / MinimumHydrologyScenarios.py)
First the code takes user input to define the number of consecutive years to use for calculations. Then the window and flow rates of the minimum consecutive years are found for every trace in every ensemble. The ensembles with 'ISM' in the title only iterates through one trace. This trace is duplicated and vertically stacked then the minimum consecutive years window sum is calculated. The ensemble title, trace title, starting position, and average for the windows are stored and outputted to Excel. In-depth descriptions can be found in the comments in the script.
Notes: Only one trace in the 'ISM' ensembles are calculated because the 'ISM' traces have the same data in the same order, but offset by one cell. Doing this rids the results of redundant data. 

### Output (MinimumHydrologyScenarios / Results / 'X'yearsMinimumHydrologyResults.xlsx)
The results for the minimum consecutive years are stored in Excel files in the 'Results' folder located in the 'MinimumHydrologyScenarios' folder. 'X' represents the number of consecutive years the user chooses. The results only are overwritten when the user chooses the same number.

## Directions to Reproduce Results
### Software Needed
The software applications needed to reproduce these results are Microsoft Excel, and PyCharm.
